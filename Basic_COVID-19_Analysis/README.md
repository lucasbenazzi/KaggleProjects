# Basic Correlation Analysis of COVID-19 Cases

This is my first Kaggle project, so starting from the basics.

In this Kaggle notebook, I did a basic correlation analysis of some information related to COVID-19 worldwide.

The dataset used had information related to:
* cases
* deaths
* tests
* vaccines
* population
* median age
* GPD per capita

A better description of what was done on the notebook can be found on the notebook itself. I tried to be as detailed as possible, even on this simple project.
