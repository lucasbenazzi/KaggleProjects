# Store Sales Time Series Prediction

This notebook focused on using the availalbe data on the [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) competition  to predict sales of 54 stores in Ecuador.

The competition was evaluated by calculating the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error. I was able to get a score of 0.43758. At the time of publishing the best score on the leaderboard was 0.38147 by Ozzy.

More information of the project and some code documentation can be found on the notebook itself.
